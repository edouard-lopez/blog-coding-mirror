# Who am I?

I'm a French developer, I studied Cognitive Science and Computer Science and love to travel.

# What do I do?

As a Web stack developer, I'm using the best available tools for my job.

* Workflow include: `npm`, `yo`, `bower`, `grunt`, `angularJS`.
* I'm fluent in `PHP`, `JS`, `XSLT`, `bash`, etc.
* and trained to `UX`/`IA` scopes.
